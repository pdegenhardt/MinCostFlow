## Key Achievements

1. **Clean Architecture**: Well-separated concerns with proper interfaces
2. **Performance Foundation**: Data structures optimized for cache efficiency
3. **LEMON Compatibility**: Matching algorithmic structure and naming
4. **Test Infrastructure**: Unit tests for components + integration tests ready
5. **Build System**: Clean build with code analysis compliance

## Technical Challenges Encountered

### 1. NuGet Package Corruption ✅
- **Issue**: Empty .nuspec files causing "Root element missing" errors
- **Solution**: Clear package cache and force restore
- **Learning**: WSL2 environment can have cache corruption issues

### 2. Thread Index Complexity ✅
- **Issue**: LEMON's thread structure is intricate with many invariants
- **Challenge**: Circular doubly-linked list through tree nodes
- **Solution**: Fixed initialization to properly close the cycle
- **Result**: Simple test cases now working correctly

### 3. Lower Bounds Transformation ✅
- **Issue**: Lower bounds not properly handled in transformation
- **Solution**: Store original bounds and restore in results
- **Result**: Lower bounds test now passing

### 4. Tree Update Logic ✅
- **Issue**: Complex subtree rethreading operations
- **Challenge**: Maintaining all tree invariants during updates
- **Solution**: Implemented complete LEMON updateTreeStructure logic
- **Result**: All tests passing, no more infinite loops

## Metrics

### Code Volume
- **Core Library**: ~2,500 lines (includes IO/DimacsReader)
- **Tests**: ~500 lines  
- **Benchmarks**: ~500 lines
- **Documentation**: ~600 lines

### Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 18 passing (types, graph operations)
- **Integration Tests**: 6 passing
  - Simple cases (2-3 nodes): ✅ passing
  - Lower bounds test: ✅ passing
  - Transportation problem: ✅ passing
  - Circulation with negative cycles: ✅ passing
  - Infeasible problem detection: ✅ passing
- **Total Tests**: 24 passing

### Performance (Validated)
- **Graph Operations**: < 1μs per operation
- **Memory Layout**: Optimal cache alignment
- **10,000 nodes, 15,000 arcs**: 1085ms (target: < 1s)
- **Memory usage**: ~1MB (target: < 200MB)
- **Small problems**: < 10ms solve time

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start Simple**: Beginning with 2-node test cases was the right approach
2. **Debug Early**: Adding debug output helped identify the exact issue location
3. **Reference Implementation**: LEMON's code is the definitive source - follow it exactly
4. **Incremental Validation**: Each component needs thorough unit tests
5. **Complex Algorithm Porting**: Don't try to "improve" or simplify - port exactly first
6. **UpdatePotentials Bug**: Small details matter - starting from Thread[u] vs u made the difference
7. **Tree Invariants**: The complete LEMON logic for LastSucc updates is critical

## Week 2 Prerequisites

1. ✅ Fix thread initialization bugs - DONE
2. ✅ Correct tree update logic - DONE
