# Gort Graph Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the completed implementation of Gort graph data structures as specified in `/docs/spec/graph.md`.

## Completed Work

### 1. IGraphBase Interface Extensions
- Added `GraphNodeIndexer` wrapper class to provide convenient indexer access
- Added `Nodes()` extension method that returns a `GraphNodeIndexer`
- Allows syntax like `graph.Nodes()[v]` to iterate over outgoing neighbors
- File: `/src/MinCostFlow.Core/Gort/IGraphBase.cs`

### 2. StaticGraph Implementation
- Memory-efficient static graph with O(1) OutDegree operation
- Implements Build() method that reorders arcs for cache-efficient iteration
- Memory usage: (NodeCapacity + 1) + 2 × ArcCapacity integers
- Features:
  - Arc reordering during Build() with permutation tracking
  - Cumulative arc count storage for efficient iteration
  - Support for large graphs (tested with 100K+ nodes)
- Files: 
  - `/src/MinCostFlow.Core/Gort/StaticGraph.cs`
  - `/src/MinCostFlow.Tests/Gort/StaticGraphTests.cs`

### 3. ReverseArcStaticGraph Implementation
- Static graph with reverse arc support using 1-based arc indexing
- Supports negative arc indices for reverse arcs (arc ∈ [-NumArcs, NumArcs], arc ≠ 0)
- Memory usage: 2 × (NodeCapacity + 1) + 3 × ArcCapacity integers
- Features:
  - Separate tracking of outgoing and incoming arcs
  - Efficient InDegree and IncomingArcs operations
  - OppositeArc(arc) = -arc
  - Complex Build() process to set up bidirectional mappings
- Files:
  - `/src/MinCostFlow.Core/Gort/ReverseArcStaticGraph.cs`
  - `/src/MinCostFlow.Tests/Gort/ReverseArcStaticGraphTests.cs`

### 4. Performance Benchmarks
- Created comprehensive benchmarks for all graph implementations
- Categories:
  - Construction performance (small/medium/large graphs)
  - Iteration performance (OutgoingArcs traversal)
  - Memory usage benchmarks
  - Complete graph performance
- Benchmark configurations:
  - Small: 1,000 nodes, 5,000 arcs
  - Medium: 10,000 nodes, 50,000 arcs
  - Large: 100,000 nodes, 500,000 arcs
- File: `/src/MinCostFlow.Benchmarks/GortGraphBenchmarks.cs`

### 5. Memory Usage Verification
- Created tests to verify each implementation matches specification memory formulas
- Verified formulas:
  - ListGraph: NodeCapacity + 3 × ArcCapacity
  - ReverseArcListGraph: 2 × NodeCapacity + 4 × ArcCapacity
  - StaticGraph: (NodeCapacity + 1) + 2 × ArcCapacity
  - ReverseArcStaticGraph: 2 × (NodeCapacity + 1) + 3 × ArcCapacity
  - CompleteGraph: O(1) - just stores n
  - CompleteBipartiteGraph: O(1) - just stores n and m
- Includes tests for SVector and ZVector memory efficiency
- File: `/src/MinCostFlow.Tests/Gort/MemoryUsageTests.cs`

## Previously Implemented Components
The following were already implemented before this session:
- IGraphBase interface
- ListGraph (dynamic linked-list implementation)
- ReverseArcListGraph (dynamic with reverse arc support)
- CompleteGraph (implicit complete graph)
- CompleteBipartiteGraph (implicit complete bipartite graph)
- GraphUtilities (permutation operations)
- SVector (vector supporting negative indices)
- ZVector (zero-based vector with pointer arithmetic)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1-Based Arc Indexing for Reverse Arc Graphs
- ReverseArcStaticGraph uses 1-based arc indexing to reserve 0 as invalid
- This allows negative indices to represent reverse arcs
- Consistent with LEMON's approach for reverse arc graphs

### Build() Permutation Handling
- StaticGraph returns 0-based permutation indices
- ReverseArcStaticGraph returns 1-based permutation indices
- Tests were updated to handle both indexing schemes appropriately

### Memory Efficiency
- All implementations strictly follow the memory formulas from the specification
- Static graphs use arrays for cache-efficient iteration
- Complete graphs use O(1) memory by computing arc indices on the fly

## Testing Coverage
- All implementations have comprehensive unit tests
- Memory usage is verified against specification formulas
- Large graph handling is tested up to 100K nodes
- Performance characteristics are benchmarked

## Notes on Complete Graphs
CompleteGraph and CompleteBipartiteGraph are implicit graphs that don't support the same operations as dynamic graphs:
- They don't support AddNode/AddArc in the traditional sense (all arcs exist implicitly)
- They don't support Reserve operations in the traditional sense (they expand to accommodate)
- They have fixed OutDegree based on their structure
- This is by design and matches the specification

## Test Structure
The test suite was updated to properly handle the different types of graphs:
- Dynamic graphs (ListGraph, StaticGraph, ReverseArcListGraph, ReverseArcStaticGraph) inherit from GraphBaseTests
- Implicit graphs (CompleteGraph, CompleteBipartiteGraph) have their own custom test classes
- This separation ensures tests are appropriate for each graph type's behavior

## All Tests Passing
All 156 Gort-related tests are now passing, including:
- Base graph functionality tests
- Static graph build and permutation tests
- Reverse arc graph tests with 1-based indexing
- Complete graph tests
- Memory usage verification tests
- Performance benchmarks compile successfully

## Conclusion
All outstanding work specified in `/docs/spec/graph.md` has been completed successfully. The Gort graph implementations provide a comprehensive set of memory-efficient graph data structures suitable for minimum cost flow algorithms.
