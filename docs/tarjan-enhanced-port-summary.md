# TarjanEnhanced Port Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to port TarjanEnhanced.cs to match OR-Tools' min_cost_flow.cc implementation.

## Major Changes

### 1. Algorithm Structure
- Changed from a pure cost-scaling push-relabel to match OR-Tools' implementation
- Added proper initialization sequence: CheckInputConsistency → CheckFeasibility → ScaleCosts → Optimize
- Separated cost scaling into ScaleCosts() and UnscaleCosts() methods

### 2. Data Structures
- Changed from array-based active nodes to Stack<int> for proper LIFO behavior
- Added missing fields:
  - `_initialNodeExcess` to track original supplies
  - `_numRelabelsSinceLastPriceUpdate` for price update triggering
  - `_usesPriceUpdate` and `_scalesPrices` flags
  - `_checkFeasibility` flag

### 3. Core Methods Updated

#### Refine()
- Now calls SaturateAdmissibleArcs() at the start
- Properly initializes active node stack
- Implements price update triggering based on relabel count

#### UpdatePrices()
- Complete rewrite to match OR-Tools' BFS-based implementation
- Proper handling of potential overflow
- Correct update of first admissible arcs

#### Discharge()
- Added look-ahead optimization for inactive nodes
- Proper tracking of first admissible arc
- Returns bool for error handling

#### Relabel()
- Matches OR-Tools' guaranteed potential update logic
- Proper handling of nodes with no outgoing arcs
- Better first admissible arc tracking

### 4. New Methods Added
- `CheckInputConsistency()` - validates input data and checks for overflow
- `CheckFeasibility()` - placeholder for max-flow based feasibility check
- `CheckResult()` - validates the solution
- `ScaleCosts()` / `UnscaleCosts()` - separate cost scaling logic
- `Optimize()` - main optimization loop
- `ResetFirstAdmissibleArcs()` - initializes admissible arc pointers
- `SetCheckFeasibility()` / `SetPriceScaling()` - configuration setters

### 5. Enum Updates
Added missing SolverStatus values:
- Unbalanced
- BadCostRange
- BadResult

## Known Limitations

1. **CheckFeasibility() is not fully implemented** - The OR-Tools version uses a MaxFlow solver which is not yet available in the C# port. Currently returns true.

2. **ReadOnlySpan limitations** - The graph interface returns ReadOnlySpan<Arc> which doesn't support LINQ operations like FirstOrDefault() or SkipWhile(). Manual loops were used instead.

3. **Missing auxiliary solver** - OR-Tools has a SimpleMinCostFlow wrapper that handles feasibility checking. This would need to be implemented separately.

## Testing Recommendations

1. Compare results with OR-Tools on standard test problems
2. Verify performance on large-scale instances
3. Test edge cases:
   - Unbalanced problems
   - Problems with cost overflow
   - Infeasible problems (when CheckFeasibility is implemented)
   - Problems with very large/small epsilon values

## Future Work

1. Implement proper CheckFeasibility() using a MaxFlow solver
2. Add SimpleMinCostFlow wrapper for easier API
3. Performance profiling and optimization
4. Add more comprehensive unit tests matching OR-Tools test suite
