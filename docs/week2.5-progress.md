# Week 2.5 Progress Report

## Overview
Week 2.5 focused on implementing a comprehensive solution validation framework for the Network Simplex algorithm, adding DIMACS format support with performance testing, and creating a centralized Problems library with embedded resources for all test data.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Solution Validation Framework
- **Implemented `SolutionValidator` class** - A robust validator that checks all aspects of minimum cost flow solutions
- **Multi-type support** - Handles EQ (equality), GEQ (greater-or-equal), and LEQ (less-or-equal) supply constraints
- **Comprehensive checks**:
  - Flow conservation with inequality support
  - Capacity constraint validation
  - Complementary slackness conditions (arc and node)
  - Dual cost verification
  - Detailed error reporting

### 2. Enhanced Testing Infrastructure
- **100% validator coverage** - All 8 tests now use the solution validator
- **New test cases** - Added specific tests for GEQ supply type handling
- **Improved error reporting** - Detailed messages for debugging validation failures
- **Test organization** - Clear separation between different test scenarios

### 3. API Improvements
- **Added `SupplyType` property** - Public getter on NetworkSimplex for external access
- **Better encapsulation** - Validator can now access solver internals properly
- **Maintained LEMON compatibility** - Follows the same validation approach as LEMON

### 4. DIMACS Format Support and Testing
- **Implemented DIMACS reader** - Full support for standard minimum cost flow format
- **Gurobi comparison tests** - Verified our solutions match commercial solver exactly
- **Performance benchmarking** - Tested on problems ranging from 256 to 32,768 nodes
- **Fixed iteration limit bug** - Dynamic limit based on problem size (was hardcoded at 10K)

### 5. Comprehensive Performance Testing

| Problem | Nodes | Arcs | Solve Time | Performance | Objective Value |
|---------|-------|------|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| netgen_8_08a | 256 | 2,048 | ~2 ms | ~1,000 arcs/ms | 142,274,536 |
| netgen_8_13a | 8,192 | 65,536 | ~258 ms | ~254 arcs/ms | 1,184,953,451 |
| netgen_8_14a | 16,384 | 131,072 | ~773 ms | ~170 arcs/ms | 1,772,056,888 |
| netgen_8_15a | 32,768 | 262,144 | ~1,949 ms | ~135 arcs/ms | 2,704,236,434 |

- **Performance scaling**: Maintains 135-1000 arcs/ms across problem sizes
- **Validation**: All solutions verified against Gurobi (where available)
- **Memory efficiency**: Handles 32K+ node problems without issues

### 6. MinCostFlow.Problems Library (NEW)
- **Created comprehensive Problems project** - Centralized repository for all test problems and solutions
- **Embedded resource system** - All benchmark data files now embedded in assembly
- **Eliminated file dependencies** - Tests no longer depend on file paths or directory structures
- **Integrated Gurobi solutions** - Reference solutions embedded for validation

#### Problems Library Structure

#### StandardProblems API
```csharp
// Simple access to problems
var problem = StandardProblems.Dimacs.Netgen8_08a;

// Get optimal solution
var solution = StandardProblems.Solutions.Netgen8_08a;
Assert.Equal("Gurobi", solution.Source);
Assert.Equal(142274536, solution.OptimalCost);

// Iterate over problem sets
foreach (var p in StandardProblems.Small.All()) { }
foreach (var p in StandardProblems.Dimacs.All()) { }
```

## Technical Details

### Validation Components
1. **Flow Conservation**
   ```csharp
   // EQ: net_flow == supply
   // GEQ: net_flow >= supply  
   // LEQ: net_flow <= supply
   ```

2. **Complementary Slackness**
   - Arc conditions: Reduced cost vs. flow relationships
   - Node conditions: Potential sign constraints based on supply type

3. **Dual Cost Validation**
   - Verifies primal cost equals dual cost for optimal solutions
   - Handles non-zero lower bounds correctly

### Enhanced Solution Model
```csharp
public class Solution
{
    public long OptimalCost { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<int, long> ArcFlows { get; set; }
    public Dictionary<(int source, int target), long> ArcFlowsByEndpoints { get; set; }
    public string Source { get; set; } = "Unknown";  // "Gurobi", "LEMON", etc.
    public DateTime? GeneratedAt { get; set; }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: GEQ/LEQ Validation
**Problem**: Validator was failing for GEQ problems with excess supply.
**Solution**: Implemented proper inequality checking and node dual feasibility conditions based on LEMON's approach.

### Challenge 2: Artificial Arcs
**Problem**: Solver internally uses artificial arcs not visible in the original graph.
**Solution**: Designed validator to work with the original graph structure while accounting for the mathematical properties of the solution.

### Challenge 3: Large Problem Iteration Limit
**Problem**: Solver was failing on problems with 8K+ nodes due to hardcoded 10K iteration limit.
**Solution**: Implemented dynamic iteration limit based on problem size (max of 1M or nodes × arcs).

### Challenge 4: Resource Naming Issues
**Problem**: Embedded resources had duplicate "Resources." prefix causing load failures.
**Solution**: Fixed EmbeddedResourceLoader constructor to avoid double prefixing.

### Challenge 5: Solution Format Mismatch
**Problem**: Solution files used "f SRC DST FLOW" but loader expected "f ARC_ID FLOW".
**Solution**: Enhanced parser to handle both formats and store flows by endpoints.

## Metrics

- Problems embedded: 16 problems + 12 solutions
- Code coverage: All validation and loading paths tested

- Gurobi comparison: 100% match on all test cases

## Learnings
1. **Supply type matters** - Different constraint types require different validation logic
2. **Dual feasibility** - Node potentials must satisfy specific sign constraints based on supply type
3. **Complementary slackness** - Critical for verifying optimality in linear programming
4. **LEMON's approach** - Following the reference implementation ensures correctness
5. **Problem size scaling** - Iteration limits must be proportional to problem complexity
6. **Performance validation** - Comparing with commercial solvers (Gurobi) validates both correctness and competitiveness
7. **Embedded resources** - Eliminate file path dependencies and improve test portability
8. **Centralized problem management** - Single source of truth simplifies maintenance
