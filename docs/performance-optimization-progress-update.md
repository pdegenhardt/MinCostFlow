# NetworkSimplex Performance Optimization Progress Update

## Overview
This document summarizes the progress made on optimizing the NetworkSimplex solver performance to match OR-Tools benchmarks.

## Completed Optimizations

### 1. Feature Flags Framework ✓
- Implemented `OptimizationFlags` enum for A/B testing
- Created `OptimizationConfig` class for tuning parameters
- Easy enabling/disabling of optimizations without code changes

### 2. Performance Profiling Infrastructure ✓
- Added `SolverMetrics` class with detailed timing breakdowns
- Implemented high-precision microsecond timing using `Stopwatch.ElapsedTicks`
- Created quick benchmark command (`--quick-opt`) for rapid iteration
- Phase-wise timing: pivot search, tree update, potential update

### 3. SmallBlocksForDense Optimization ✓
- Reduces block size from √m to min(50, √m/4) for dense networks
- **Performance: 27% improvement** (1040ms → 760ms)
- Trades 30% more iterations for faster per-iteration time
- Simple but effective optimization for dense circulation problems

### 4. Adaptive Block Size ✓
- Dynamically adjusts block size based on hit rate
- Successfully tuned parameters:
  - Min block size: 25 (up from 10)
  - Shrink/growth factors: 0.8x/1.2x (gentler than 0.5x/1.5x)
  - Requires 3 consecutive hits before adapting
- **Performance: 24% improvement** when used alone
- Combined with SmallBlocks: 20% improvement

### 5. High-Precision Timing ✓
- Replaced millisecond timing with microsecond precision
- Now accurately shows phase breakdown:
  - Baseline: 37.5% pivot, 21.3% tree, 13.5% potential
  - Optimized: 12% pivot, 29% tree, 22% potential
- Reveals that pivot search optimization shifts bottleneck to tree operations

### 6. Reduced Cost Caching (Partial) ⚠️
- Infrastructure implemented:
  - Adjacency lists for O(degree) updates instead of O(m)
  - Incremental updates during potential changes
  - Proper dirty flag management
- **Issue**: Still too slow for dense networks
- Needs further optimization before production use

## Performance Results Summary

| Configuration | Time (ms) | Improvement | Iterations | Time/Iter (μs) |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------------|
| Baseline     | 925-1040  | -           | 96,258     | 8.8            |
| SmallBlocks  | 725-760   | **27%**     | 124,916    | 5.6            |
| AdaptiveBlocks| 775-835  | **24%**     | 142,905    | 5.6            |
| Both         | 725-874   | **20%**     | 144,041    | 5.2            |

## Detailed Timing Breakdown

With high-precision timing, we can see where time is spent:

| Phase            | Baseline | Optimized | Change |
|------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Pivot Search     | 37.5%    | 12.1%     | -67%   |
| Tree Update      | 21.3%    | 28.7%     | +35%   |
| Potential Update | 13.5%    | 22.5%     | +67%   |
| Other            | 27.7%    | 36.7%     | +32%   |

The optimizations successfully reduced pivot search time but revealed that tree operations become the new bottleneck.

## Pending Optimizations

### 1. Fix Reduced Cost Caching
- Current implementation has performance issues
- Need to investigate why adjacency list updates are slow
- Consider lazy evaluation or batch updates
- Expected: 20-30% additional improvement

### 2. Iteration Count Monitoring
- Add warnings when iterations exceed baseline by >50%
- Auto-revert to larger blocks if quality degrades
- Implement iteration prediction based on problem characteristics

### 3. Problem Characteristic Detection
- Identify problem types: transportation, circulation, assignment
- Auto-select optimization flags based on density and structure
- Create preset configurations for common problem types

### 4. Tree Operation Optimization
- Now the primary bottleneck (29% of time)
- Consider SIMD for batch potential updates
- Optimize memory access patterns in thread traversal

## Comparison with Target

- **Current Best**: ~725ms (optimized) vs 265ms (baseline)
- **OR-Tools**: 80ms
- **Progress**: Achieved 27% improvement, need 9x more to match OR-Tools
- **Gap Analysis**: Need fundamental algorithmic improvements

## Next Steps

1. **Debug reduced cost caching** - Fix performance regression
2. **Profile tree operations** - Identify optimization opportunities  
3. **Test on larger problems** - Verify scalability
4. **Implement candidate list pivot** - Alternative pivot strategy
5. **Consider parallel algorithms** - For very large problems

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simple optimizations work** - Block size reduction gave 27% improvement
2. **Adaptive parameters need careful tuning** - Too aggressive = quality loss
3. **Profiling reveals surprising bottlenecks** - Tree ops became dominant
4. **Dense networks have unique characteristics** - Need specialized handling
5. **Feature flags enable safe experimentation** - Can test in production

## Conclusion

We've made solid progress with 27% performance improvement through relatively simple optimizations. The infrastructure is now in place for more advanced optimizations. While we haven't yet matched OR-Tools performance, we have a clear understanding of the bottlenecks and a roadmap for further improvements.
