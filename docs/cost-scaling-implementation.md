# Cost-Scaling Push-Relabel Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented the cost-scaling push-relabel algorithm as an alternative solver for minimum cost flow problems. This implementation is based on LEMON's highly optimized `cost_scaling.h`.

## Implementation Status

### Completed ✅
- **Core Algorithm Structure** (`CostScaling.cs`)
  - Implements `IMinCostFlowSolver` interface
  - Residual network construction
  - Epsilon-scaling phases
  - Push operations with push-look-ahead heuristic
  - Relabel operations
  - Node potential management
  - Active node queue management

- **Method Support**
  - Push method (local push operations) - **Implemented and working**
  - Augment method (full path augmentation) - **Implemented and working**
  - PartialAugment method (limited path length) - **Implemented and working**

- **Key Features**
  - Handles networks without lower bounds
  - Correct flow computation from residual capacities
  - Proper excess initialization (fixed bug where supplies were incorrectly copied)
  - Epsilon scaling with configurable alpha parameter
  - Push-look-ahead heuristic for better performance

### Tests
- `CostScalingTests.cs` - Basic unit tests
- `CostScalingVerySimpleTests.cs` - Simple single-arc test case
- `CostScalingDebugTests.cs` - Minimal debug test
- `CostScalingAugmentTests.cs` - Tests for augment and partial augment methods
- All tests passing ✅

## Algorithm Details

### Time Complexity
- O(n²m log(nK)) where:
  - n = number of nodes
  - m = number of arcs
  - K = maximum absolute arc cost

### Key Concepts

1. **Epsilon-Scaling**: The algorithm works in phases, gradually reducing epsilon from max cost to 1
2. **Push-Relabel**: Maintains node excesses and pushes flow along admissible arcs
3. **Residual Network**: Forward and backward arcs with artificial root for supply/demand
4. **Admissible Arcs**: Arcs with negative reduced cost (within epsilon tolerance)

### Important Bug Fix

The initial implementation had a bug where node excess values were incorrectly initialized from the original supply values. In the residual network formulation, supplies/demands are handled via arcs to/from an artificial root node, so the excess array should start at zero. This fix resolved the issue where the algorithm was returning incorrect flow values.

## Future Work

1. **Add Lower Bound Support**: Currently throws NotImplementedException for problems with lower bounds
2. **Optimize Path Finding**: The augment implementation could be further optimized with better path selection heuristics
3. **Implement Price Refinement**: The heuristic is stubbed out but not implemented
4. **Global Update Optimization**: Currently simplified, could use Bellman-Ford for better performance
5. **Initial Feasible Flow**: LEMON uses a circulation algorithm to find initial feasible flow
6. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare against NetworkSimplex on large problems

## Usage Example

```csharp
var graph = new GraphBuilder()
    .AddNodes(2)
    .AddArc(0, 1)
    .Build();

var solver = new CostScaling(graph);
solver.SetNodeSupply(new Node(0), 5);
solver.SetNodeSupply(new Node(1), -5);
solver.SetArcCost(new Arc(0), 10);
solver.SetArcBounds(new Arc(0), 0, 10);

var status = solver.Solve(CostScaling.Method.Push);
if (status == SolverStatus.Optimal)
{
    var flow = solver.GetFlow(new Arc(0));  // Returns 5
    var cost = solver.GetTotalCost();        // Returns 50
}
```

## Performance Expectations

Based on the algorithmic complexity analysis, CostScaling should outperform NetworkSimplex on:
- Large dense networks (where NetworkSimplex might need many pivots)
- Problems with large cost values
- Initial solution finding (no warm-start needed)

NetworkSimplex maintains advantages for:
- Warm-starting from previous solutions
- Sparse networks where pivot count is low
- Problems requiring sensitivity analysis
